# Churn Rate Prediction Model 

## Short Description 
The **Churn Rate Model** is designed to help businesses understand customer retention trends by predicting which users are likely to churn. By analyzing customer behavior data, the model can identify at-risk customers and provide actionable insights that can lead to higher retention rates.

The model uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze various features of customer data, such as usage patterns, engagement levels, and demographic information. This helps businesses tailor their strategies and take proactive steps to retain valuable customers.



# Problem Statement
## Using Real Life World Problem 
## Problem
*BUSBARS* wants to identify at-risk customers who are likely to churn before they actually leave. The goal is to predict customer churn based on their behavior and usage patterns so the company can take proactive steps, such as offering discounts, personalized recommendations, or exclusive content, to retain them. 

## Solution 
A machine learning-based churn prediction model is trained on historical customer data, including:

* Subscription length

* Watch time per session

* Customer complaints or feedback

* Frequency of login activity

* Payment history and billing issues

By analyzing this data, the model predicts which customers are most likely to churn within the next month. The business can then target these users with personalized marketing campaigns, loyalty offers, or improved customer support to prevent churn.

## Impact:
Improved Retention Rate: By identifying high-risk customers, StreamFlix can take proactive measures to retain them.

Revenue Growth: Reduced churn means higher long-term revenue and customer lifetime value.

Better User Experience: Analyzing why customers leave helps improve content recommendations and platform features.
